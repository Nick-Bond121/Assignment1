<h2>Interest in IT</h2> 
<p>My interests in IT revolve around interactive activities and digital entertainment, which is just a fancy way of saying I like to play video games 
and come up with ideas for future ones I hope to see or now as i study, hope to develop personally. I do enjoy the development of applications that serve humanity 
in different ways since my partner is diabetic I have also taken an interest in medical programs that help ease certain health restrictions like diabetes,
Asthma and even heart disease issues.  </p>

<h2>Ideal Job</h2>
<p>My ideal job is in the gaming and application development now australia has a small market for these but i found a job here i would love to get into. </p>

<p>https://www.seek.com.au/job/50935699?type=standard#searchRequestToken=cbb0fd3d-ef00-4370-bd30-dfd4c29294a4</p>

<p>This job to me seems like i would be working with a large group and helping oversee projects big and small in the gaming industry which 
in itself could be a rather fun if demanding job setting in its early phase, the skills needed would be a large understanding of IT, a moderate 
to expert understanding of programming and project management and therfore qualifications in Gaming and Entertainment would be the perfect direction to move through, 
my current expeirience is a very basic grasp on coding and how IT works so out of a hundred id say i have about 10/100 skills necessary to be a part of this industry. 
I plan to take several more undergrad courses revolving around IT and digital media and then move into a full on university degree in Gaming and Entertainment in 
order to give myself a better chance at building my career and lead into the linked job or jobs of a similar field. </p>

<h1>Profile</h1>
<p>As per the directions for this assignment i have put myself through several tests to determine my personality type, my learning style and a deeper understanding of my personality using three different sites. 
The first was the Myer-Briggs test which determined that I am INFP-T a mediator. I used education planner to determine my learning style type which determined I am 40% Auditory, 20% Visual and 40% Tactile. 
lastly the other test using bite back/Black Dog was a test that expanded upon the knowledge of INFP-T and the type of qualities i have that may not fit into that category correctly.</p>
 
<P>At first I always find personality tests to just be a weird way of justifying attitude towards people and get away with being bad just because your personality profile told you what string of letters you were, 
however the main test of this assignment really did explain everything I already knew about myself but gave me visual data not just some words explaining what being INFP-T is. To me I feel that I am a very ambivert 
individual and the test really did say that, I may not agree fully with my learning style but that said I find myself flitting and flicking between what works for me visually/audibly.</p>

<h1>Project Ideas</h1>
<p>I think a project I would do that I think others would be interested in is find a way to develop an interactive game even with simple multiple choice options that can help 
 teach people how to identify a  high or low blood sugar problem with a person with diabetes.</p> 

<p>As someone living with a partner with diabetes and learning how to assist in helping manage it when/if it goes wrong its a rather important issue this would include how to administer glycogen to a low blood sugar and
how to test for ketones if they appear to have a high blood sugar, with the end result telling them how well they did and hopefully educate them for any future situation that may involve helping someone having one of these 
life threatening responses. I have seen high ketones and think others should know the results of High/Low blood sugars.</p>
 
<p>The motivation behind this is that 1 in 11 adults have diabetes, one in two are undiagnosed and the thought of that is quite scary especially when you consider just how many people undiagnosed and those who know they are safe from diabetes
are not educated enough in how to manage Type 1 diabetes, I have some really interesting sources to site all from personal experience and from the mouth of someone close to me with Type 1 Diabetes. There are many people with Type 2 as well that this 
little education tool would also be included in because the only thing that comes to mind is how scary would it be to be surrounded by people when you are going into shock and absolutely no one can help? Now first thought would be to call an ambulance/doctor 
or get them in a car and take them to a hospital but you may not make it in time before too much damage is done, by following simple steps you could help get them to a hospital, have an ambulance arrive and have made sure the person makes the trip to where they need to be. 
This all seems rather repetitive but by saying the same thing enough times it helps solidify a thought in someone’s mind. “Being Educated Can Save Lives.” 
I may not be a diabetes educator so this tool would simply be a personal project (In a group) to see how quick and direct people can react to particular stressors in the world. The Current issue I found with myself is I can identify high and low blood sugar reactions to a 
degree based on mood changes, appetite and other things because these changes are not subtle, but if I am not around until the last minute and come home to an unconscious partner or friend I need to know how to identify the issue, the best course of action and how to carry it 
out without being overwhelmed by stress. Stress is the biggest problem in medical emergencies, seeing/being in a car accident you will panic and not give all the right information to the right people, and the same happens with diabetic emergencies. This project idea comes from 
when my partner was having a high blood sugar emergency, at first because I had never seen this happen I assumed food poisoning, vomiting, fever, nausea these were the symptoms I was being told, but a symptom I missed was an inability to think properly as the answers were vague at best. 
If I had known to test for Ketones I would have seen how bad they were and take my partner to the hospital as soon as I could, but I was so uneducated that all I could do was wait for the doctors appointment which they saw what was wrong and instantly called an ambulance. If I was more 
 educated on the situation I could have been more helpful.</p>
 
<p>Tools that will be needed are good coding environments, Eclipse is a basic but useful tool, you can use Notepad++ which would be useful as a back up/skeleton building tool. Taking into account that in some cases 
you would want a free  and very simple tool especially for those new to coding.
 
<p>Skills needed to make this work is a basic understanding of writing code and creating an easy web based quiz, an understanding of diabetes and how to respond to medical emergencies because of it and decent literacy skills in 
 order to be clear and concise with the actions the user must take.</p>
 
<p>If this project is successful, then it would hopefully have educated at least one person on how to manage a diabetic emergency, which even just one person capable of asking the right questions and making the right choices saves 
 many more lives than you would think just from theory.</p>
